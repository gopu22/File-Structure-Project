# File-Structure-Project:
As a file structure project, i worked on a topic called " Virtual File System " , i wrote a code in Python with LINUX commands, which creates files, directories, &amp; can even make changes like (copy, delete, rename, move, etc..)

Use 'cat' command in your terminal to display the code content and run this code by 'python3 vfs.py' and you can make the files & Directories.
